> C2, also known as Command and Control, refers to the infrastructure and techniques used by hackers to maintain control over compromised systems or networks. By establishing a connection with these compromised systems, hackers can execute their malicious activities

## About:

A C2-like (command and control) framework and multiple reverse shell handler, it provides support for Linux and Windows environments, with advanced shell control features and generation of obfuscated powershell payloads to bypass Windows AV.

- Support for multiple reverse TCP connections.
- Make quick and easy transitions between all your reverse shell connections
- Compatible with Linux and Windows systems.
- Improved functionality for controlling and using shell sessions.
- Generation of obfuscated powershell payloads to avoid detection.

Made for pentest operations or attack simulations focused on evading initial detection and managing sessions in different environments.


| **New features and implementations will be continually added to the project** |


## Usage:

## Tribute:

I'd like to take a moment to express my absolute admiration for these offensive security programmers/researchers. They inspired me to decide to create this tool, and I really hope I can achieve this level of capability.
