> C2, also known as Command and Control, refers to the infrastructure and techniques used by hackers to maintain control over compromised systems or networks. By establishing a connection with these compromised systems, hackers can execute their malicious activities

## About:

Koopa Shell is an advanced tool developed in Rust, designed as a Multiple Reverse TCP Shell Handler and Stage 0/1 C2 Framework, it elevates shell interactions by generating obfuscated PowerShell payload, ensuring both stealth and efficiency. Koopa Shell supports seamless connections across Linux and Windows environments, making it a versatile for working in diverse infrastructures.

- Support for multiple reverse TCP connections.
- Make quick and easy transitions between all your reverse shell connections
- Compatible with Linux and Windows systems.
- Improved functionality for controlling and using shell sessions.
- Generation of obfuscated powershell payloads to avoid detection.

Made for pentest operations or attack simulations focused on evading initial detection and managing sessions in different environments.


| **New features and implementations will be continually added to the project** |

## New Features:

- ðŸ“Œ**NEW**: Added an easier way to connect to and navigate through sessions (Sessions index)
- ðŸ“Œ**NEW**: The format of the session IDs has been changed to hexadecimal (16 bit) code.
- ðŸ•’ **Coming soon**: New payload types for linux and windows

## Usage:

## Tribute:

I'd like to take a moment to express my absolute admiration for these offensive security programmers/researchers. They inspired me to decide to create this tool, and I really hope I can achieve this level of capability.
